# Welcome to the UCC RobotC Code and Knowledge Library

This repository houses the RobotC code for the Upper Canada College Robotics team, and also functions as a wiki for solving common issues within the RobotC programming software.

The code used in the last competition is in the surface directory of `master`. All other RobotC code, as well as other C-based projects that the club uses, will be located in the `archive` folder.

If you'd like to contribute, that's awesome! Fork our repo, add the changes, and then submit a pull request; alternatively, talk to either @malsf21, @jacksarick, or @Hedgeriot to get push access.
